<h1>introduction</h1>
<p>This documentation is to follow the decision process and the production of a model hand with minor articulation. It will discuss each of the major steps and their processes in producing the hand. The documentation should have photos and references to help explain reasons for decisions and references to outside materials to the same effect.
This task was a group project taken on by three people and thus has work divided between the group, decisions that where made where discussed between the group as the work was undertaken and each person was given a different task to try to complete. The tasks for the model hand where split into internal Structure, external shell and skin. This will be explained further in the next section I was given the task to make a external shell for the internal structure for the skin to sit on. 
 </p>

<h1> Problem An proposed Solution </h1>
<p> The task is to make a model hand with articulation, to plan how to do that first we should look at the real thing. A human hand has three things that we are concerned with here. Range of motion, look and feel. Firstly ill explain look, it seems simple to say but what can we see that makes up a hand. We have a palm a wrist and four fingers, of various lengths and a thumb. this makes a distinctive shape having a direction that the fingers bend in. that brings us onto the range of motion as we are only making a hand we don’t have to concern ourselves with a wrist. Just fingers an thumbs. These only bend one way, sounds silly to say but if a model hand bent the fingers backwards it would be quite disturbing , they curl onto themselves in three distinct sections each section achieving a 90 degree bend from its original position. The thumb is the exception, with only 2 sections. Lastly feel, this is skin. Our hand should feel and look like it has skin and its not just bones. This documented with greater precision by  (East Cooper Medicine Group).
Form this we can make a list of things we want to achieve, we want a hand that:
Looks like a hand with correct fingers palm and thumb, Moves like a hand  that has a palm 4 fingers of various appropriate lengths with a thumb that are covered in a “skin”.
This takes us to different tasks, we want the hand to move and the best way to do this is to replicate a real hand, (East Cooper Medicine Group) shows that hands work with tendons and bones. This can be replicated by an internal structure. Its job is to bend an be rigid like bones and tendons in a real hand. This leads us onto our next task, external shell. This shells job is to cover the internal structure in such a way that is doesn’t affect its function but provides a base that a “skin” can be added to the model and it looks like a hand. This shell will be filling the shape that muscles and fat fills normally to make a hand. Lastly we need a skin to go over the model to make it look and feel like a hand. This will literally be a imitation  flesh glove for the model. 
in summary, we want three things produced, a internal structure to provide motion to the hand. An shell to this to provide shape to the internal structure to make it look like a hand. Lastly a glove of “skin ” to provide the feel of a hand to the model. 
</p>

<h1>Finger Mark 1  </h1>
<p> This section is going to discuss the work and model finger that was produced as a potential solution for finger articulation in the final model. 
Firstly we decided to try out an idea for a prototype finger. This idea was the tendons and bones idea simplified, the idea is a string ran through 3 bits of tube within a silicone finger, ill explain why we chose silicone shortly. These tubes had big v notches cut into them so when they are pulled together the bend over each other in that desired 90 degree shape. This is an idea taken form kids toys with a hand. (adafruit) goes into detail on how to build the system at home. This is described best in an image shown in Appendix 1.a.e.  if the wires are motorised in a poratable system we can move the fingers seemingly by themselves, this is shown by (Branwyn) who makes something very similar to this. 
We chose silicone as ist the closest to skin we could get. “Silicone alone has a refractive index similar to skin (1.3–1.5), which can be further tuned by incorporating other substances and structures that can alter the interaction with light (see Nano- and Micro-fillers section) and therefore simulate a broad range of human skin optical properties.” - (Dąbrowska et al.)
That’s an extract form a paper discussing what substitutes make good skin alternatives. It shows that for our purposes that silicone would be more then enough. However we did find on thing. The colourer need to match a flesh tone, in appendixes 1.a & 1.b we can see the difference between adding some red into the silicone and leaving the silicone as it comes.  
The silicone is a 2 part mixture that is poured into a premade mould, we made this mould by setting a finger into alginate then letting it set round the finger, this leaves us with a shape that can be cast buy pouring the mixture in, once cured we remove the mould leaving us with our silicone in the desired shape. 
Appendix 2.a & 2.b show the mould we used for this test casted from a team members finger, 2.a shows how we layered a thin bit of silicone that is flesh toned round the outside of the two mould halves. Onto this we placed the yellow bits of tube with string in that have those notches as previously mentioned, in 2.b you can see the mould in a vice upright having had the last bit of silicone poured into it, we made it a vibrant green just to show the three layers. 
2.c shows the finished prototype , sadly it hasn’t given us the desired effect. Instead of the 90 degree bends the finger just scrunches backwards in a line. The hope was that the elasticity of the silicone can return the finger when tension was released  on the string and the tube makes it bend on the 90 degree angles, sadly this didn’t happen.
To fix this we could make a more secure tube system as movement as the silicone cured may have misaligned the notches resulting in this poor movement. In conclusion this method needed work, it seemed like a good simple way to gain articulation in the fingers of the model however lacked rigid in the tubes that the silicone could move in any direction when the string is pulled taught meaning that if a revised draft was going to be made I reckon we should have had a back plate on the tube to stope left and right movement as well as a more secure placement for the tube with the notches. Sadly I thing it too delicate to allow for this if we completely cover it in silicone meaning that we end up back at the internal structure idea previously outlined. 


</p>

<h1> Resin Hand </h1>
<p>In this section I’m going to discuss the process of casting a resin hand why we  did this and the process we followed to do this.
 The thinking behind casting a resin hand is twofold, firstly we want something that stayed still for the 3d scanning. We knew that the scanner performs better on objects, this is compared to my hand that wouldn’t be that still which makes the scan harder. Secondly we wanted something to cast the silicone over. A resin hand could be used by any of us to make a new mould at any time or even just cast the silicone onto it and peel it off later, this turned out not to be how the silicone would have to be casted,  however  this was the idea behind the resin hand. It turned out to be very useful as if had exact measurements didn’t change was easy to measure and all sorts.
It was made by make a cast aging, the same way as before but on a bigger scale, appendix 3.a shows us pouring into the mould the resin. The resin is very similar to the silicone, it’s a two part mixture again however when it cure it gets very hot, 90-100 degrees, this results in it curing into a rock solid casting of the mould. Sadly we couldn’t save the mould as the hand was curled when we set the mould meaning that we could just pull the resin hand out. This curled fingers problem resulted in us making another resin hand, one that had straight fingers. This allows for much easier building of internal structure as it stars straight in its effective 0 position. 
When making the first hand, the mould we used was in a five litre water bottle as the subjects hand was rounded, on our second attempt we learnt form this. We constructed a polystyrene  box that was just the with of a flat hand. It ended up being a rectangle. This was much easier to deal with and used a lot less material in making the mould for the resin.  
After having difficulty with the curled fingers hand, the thinking was that it was a relaxed hand, we saw that its much easier to make the hand flat its seems silly in Hines sight that we didn’t think to do that to begin with. 4.c shows the hand on a table being scanned, it  is the final hand that we used. It’s the second one done in that flat position, sadly we never took a photo of the hand before it was used to make the skin for the final project where it was sadly broken as the mould, 3.b.
All in all the resin hand was brilliant, we started off with a more curved less flattened hand which we changed in a second revision. This second resin hand was great reference of all points of the project further down the line, it made the 3d scan much easier and was needed to make a skin for the final hand. The set size of the resin hand and its ability to stand in for the real hand meant we could gain more accurate skin with out having to get one of our hands stuck in a mould. Its shape revision also worked out greatly as it gave us room to add things to yet to be constructed internal structure down the line. 
 </p>

<h1> 3D Scans </h1>
<p>In this section I will discuss the 3d scans that where taken how, what we found out and why we took the 3d scans.
Going into the 3d scanner we wanted to try a few things, we wanted to scan both the resin hands and our actual hands that correspond to the model. These are the appendix 4.a.e , 4.b.e  & 4.c.e . these are the extra files we have from the scan but didn’t use. 4.b.e show one of the issues this I will discuss shortly, it’s a scan of a real hand  and has a lot of discrepencisies in the mesh. That cause when the hand moves. This problem was fixed by using the resin hands which are objects that don’t move making for a better scan. 
Th process of scanning our hands was simple in the end. The 3d scanner uses reference dots of super reflective material to map is position in 3d space. It takes these points to build a mesh on what it can see in in front and around the points its tracking. This is how I makes the model, lots and lots of photos with known points all around the object. 
Taking a scan of a real hand and a scan of the resin hands was slightly different . for  the actual hands we had to place the tracking markers on the hand itself, this  is shown in 4.a , its my own hand covered in the tracking markers. One thing I found interesting of the tracking markers is that they give a bump on the model from a place where the software knows something is there this leaves raised bumps on the model that are soothed over in the software. 4.b shows the scanner and my hand about to be scanned.
The resin hands shown in 4.c didn’t have trackers placed on them, instead the hand was placed on the “scanning table” this is just a table covered in these tracking markers. This gives a excellent scan as both sides of the hand can be scanned in exact position as the had doesn’t move, it doesn’t change as finger on our actual had dis as we moved our fingers, it just gave an excellent scan .
We chose to use the 3d scanner as we wanted to do 3d printing for the internal structure and the external shell, the 3d scan gave us perfect measurements to be translated into 3D modelling software this allows us to compare and even edit the model to be printed further down the line. It was especially helpful in the exterior shell as it gave us the same dimensions that the skin would be made onto.
In summary,  from the 3d scanner we wanted digital form for the hand that we are going to form and build an internal structure.  These measurement s also allow for us make near perfect replicas of the hand model, this allows for exact forms to be made of the hand for skin casting and making of external shells. It’s a digital replica of what we want to achieve.

<h1> 3D printing and internal structure </h1>
<p> 3D printing seems like a great option for our current application, it allows for rapid prototyping. The main appeal for the 3d print was how accurate the print can be (Kluska et al.) has a paper discussing this fact. So the rapid prototyping capabilities paired with its accuracy to make a model look as close to the digital model that we have makes it a great choice for the internal and external structure for the latex skin to be added onto. The last thing to consider when talking about 3d printing is the material that it will be printing out of. (3Dnatives) gives a pretty comprehensive list of possible filament to print for my purposes we are using PLA as its very available with the bonus of being bio degradable. 
Before I can discuss what I did with the external shell I need to outline what the internal structure,  this part was made by another team member but needs to be outlined  as a preface for what  the external shell that is to be designed need to work with. The model for the internal structure is shown in 5.a. it is a single hinge form the palm to the fingers with a separate hinge for the thumb. 
Sadly when comparing it to 5.c the 3d model for  the hand we can see that the fingers on the stricter and the littile finger on the hand don’t quite meet up. This is something to take into consideration when designing the external shell. 
To conclude, here is a good argument on why we have used cad and 3d modelling software to design files intended to be 3D printed and outlined the internal  structure for reference next in the design of the external shell
Exterior shell 
This section I will discuss what I have done for the external shell of the hand model, why discuss other solutions that I came up with and  evaluate the decisions I made with my model. 
So I need to make a shell that holds the shape of a hand over the internal structure
5.a, the hand doesn’t directly fit over the internal structure perfectly so we have some options,
5.b is a single finger for the internal structure, we could take the corresponding fingers form the hand stl 5.c  this involves hollowing out the finger form the hand and fitting it over the internal stucters fingers like a hard plastic glove. The issue is see with this idea is one is actually attaching the finger to the internal finger. We then have the issues of how thick the fingers can be weather they can still bend independently past each other this added thickness . the skin would  add even more thickness to this again. 
With this in mind we can come up with a different solution that tries to maintain thinness of the fingers to ensure that each can move past each other with the skin added. To further this idea I had a look at a finger singular form the internal structure and thought about how much is actually needed. 
5.bshows the hinge and finger single. The solution that I came to was that we can combine the hinge and our already modelled fingers on the hinge to attach to the palm. 5.d shows the fingers from the modelled hand and the hinges for each on one print bed. This is the solution I’ve come too, print the hinges and fingers making the fingers solid then once printed glue them to the hinge. 
The reason for not printing them as one is because to print the fingers  with accuracy, I don’t think there is nay orientation it can print the finger and the hinge attached where it in floating part of the finger resulting I a failed print. 
Sadly I didn’t have time to print the design which I will discuss in the last section
